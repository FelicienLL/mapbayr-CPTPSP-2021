In this repository, you can find the codes and data that lead to the performance validation study of mapbayr published in [CPT:Pharmacometrics and System Pharmacology](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12689).

Summary:  
 - data: simulated data passed to NONMEM and mapbayr. Stored as .csv files.  
 - mapbayr code: mapbayr code files. Stored as .cpp files.  
 - mapbayr output: outputs generated by mapbayr. Stored as .rds files.  
 - nonmem code: NONMEM code files. Stored as .mod files.  
 - nonmem output: outputs generated by NONMEM (except for .exe files). Stored as .zip files.  

mapbayr is a free open-source R package dedicated to maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters. It is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mapbayr) and [github](https://github.com/FelicienLL/mapbayr).
